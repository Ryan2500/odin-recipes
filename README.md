In this repo I will create a simple recipes website using HTML to demonstrate the following skills acquired:

creating a title, header and body for the index page

creating functional hyperlinks to other websites

potentially creating ordered and unordered lists

using bold and italics as necessary

adding and committing my project to github with a proper commit message
